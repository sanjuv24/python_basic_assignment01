    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "Ans:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created based on an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass, allowing it to reuse code and extend the functionality of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass, reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Inheritance helps in organizing code into hierarchical structures, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Subclasses can add new attributes and methods, or override existing ones from the superclass, to customize their behavior without modifying the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphic behavior, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass, simplifying code and making it more flexible."

    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their differences and advantages.\n",
    "Ans:Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from only one superclass. In single inheritance, each subclass has only one direct superclass. This promotes simplicity and avoids the complexities that can arise from multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance leads to simpler class hierarchies, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "Encapsulation: Single inheritance promotes encapsulation by allowing classes to inherit the behavior of a single superclass, which can help in managing complexity.\n",
    "Code Reusability: Single inheritance allows subclasses to reuse code from a single superclass, leading to more efficient and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one superclass. This allows a subclass to have multiple direct superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple superclasses, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.\n",
    "Flexibility: Multiple inheritance provides more flexibility in designing class hierarchies, allowing for more complex relationships between classes.\n",
    "Specialization: Multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit behavior from multiple superclasses, enabling more specialized and specific classes to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Superclasses: Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from only one superclass, while multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one superclass.\n",
    "Complexity: Multiple inheritance can lead to more complex class hierarchies and potential conflicts, while single inheritance tends to be simpler and easier to manage.\n",
    "Diamond Problem: Multiple inheritance can lead to the diamond problem, where ambiguity arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common superclass. This problem does not occur in single inheritance.\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance provides more opportunities for code reuse, while single inheritance is more limited in this aspect."

    "\n",
    "The base class is the class that is being inherited from.\n",

    "The derived class can be thought of as a specialized version of the base class.\n",

    "4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",

    "\n",
    "Difference of \"protected\"  from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers in the context of inheritance:\n",

Subclasses can access and override protected attributes and methods of the superclass. Protected members are not accessible outside the class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Access Modifier: Attributes and methods marked as \"public\" are accessible from anywhere, both within and outside the class hierarchy. Public members can be accessed and overridden by subclasses and other classes."

    "#Ans:The super keyword in inheritance is used to call methods and access attributes of the superclass from within a subclass. It is particularly useful when the subclass overrides a method of the superclass but still wants to access the superclass's implementation of that method.\n",
