    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans: An expression is a combination of operators, constants and variables. An expression may consist of one or more operands, and zero or more operators to produce a value.\n",

    "Types of Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant expressions: Constant Expressions consists of only constant values. A constant value is one that doesn’t change.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "5, 10 + 5 / 6.0, 'x’\n",
    "\n",
    "Integral expressions: Integral Expressions are those which produce integer results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "x, x * y, x + int( 5.0)\n",
    "where x and y are integer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating expressions: Float Expressions are which produce floating point results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "x + y, 10.75\n",
    "where x and y are floating point variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational expressions: Relational Expressions yield results of type bool which takes a value true or false.\n",
    "When arithmetic expressions are used on either side of a relational operator,\n",
    "they will be evaluated first and then the results compared. Relational expressions are also known as Boolean expressions.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "x <= y, x + y > 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical expressions: Logical Expressions combine two or more relational expressions and produces bool type results.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " x > y && x == 10, x == 10 || y == 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointer expressions: Pointer Expressions produce address values.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "&x, ptr, ptr++\n",
    "where x is a variable and ptr is a pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitwise expressions: Bitwise Expressions are used to manipulate data at bit level. They are basically used for testing or shifting bits.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "x << 3\n",
    "shifts three bit position to left\n",
    "\n",
    "y >> 1\n",
    "shifts one bit position to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift operators are often used for multiplication and division by powers of two.\n",

    "Note: An expression may also use combinations of the above expressions. Such expressions are known as compound expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Expressions perform the work of a program. Among other things, expressions are used to compute and to assign values to variables and to help control the execution flow of a program.\n",

    "\n",
    "Expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is any valid combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a value.\n",

    "Statements typically do something rather than just producing a value.\n",
    "They can contain expressions, but they themselves are not expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    " In the example spam = 10, spam is a variable, 10 is a literal, and the assignment operator = is used to assign the value 10 to the variable spam.\n",
    " This is a statement because it performs an action (assigning a value to a variable), but it's not an expression because it doesn't evaluate to a value itself.\n",
